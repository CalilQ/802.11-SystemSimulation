SysSim - IEEE 802.11a System Simulator
Version 1.2
27.06.2002

Usage:

  The simulation parameters are read from configuration file "config.txt", simulation results are written in "results.txt". Both files are located in the same directory, which is given as a parameter when program is called from the command line. Default value for directory is "Data".
  More detailed information on the simulation parameters is given in default configuration file "Data\config.txt".
  

Features:

  - IEEE 802.11 MAC-DCF is implemented, both basic and RTS/CTS methods
  - both AP and STA supported
  - independent MAC instances per terminal
  - traffic model assumes exponnentially-distributed packet arrival intervals. Distribution parameter is chosen to satisfy a certain target data rate.
  - automatic rate adaptation, both with and without channel knowledge
  - distance-based propagation model with time-variant Rayleigh-fading channel
  - error model considers IEEE 802.11a physical layer
  - interference and hidden-channel considered
  - throughput is measured (overall and for each terminal)

Limitations and known bugs:

  - RTS and CTS are always transmitted at low-rate mode (6 Mbps)
  - only one data flow per STA
  - only one AP
  - traffic model assumes independent uplink and downlink traffic flows
  - no propagation delay considered
  - one single transmission channel (one single frequency)
  - frequency non-selective channel
  - interference model is based on highest interference level during a packet
  - reception of CTS/RTS by other terminals does not include interference
  - channel is variable for active links only (with data transmission), it is fixed for "interference" links

New in Version 0.1
  - batch mode supports iterative simulation with varying parameters

New in Version 0.2
  - adaptive data rate with perfect channel knowledge

New in version 0.3 (20/03/2002)
  - classes restructured
  - small bugs corrected
  - profiler implemented
  - link adaptation without a priori channel knowledge
  - command line option -no_pause (program does not pause after running)


New in version 0.4 (26/03/2002)
  - all parameters accept multiple values
  - command line option -it_file (result files are saved for each iteration)
  - if number of mobile stations is 1, then distance is fixed (equal to CellRadius)
  - if _SAVE_RATE_ADAPT is defined in "precompiler.h" then channel gain and data rate are saved in file
  - fading channel is now generated by Jakes' method, same channel is now obtained for every simulation with same seed
  - as specified in the standards, ACK is tranmitted with same data rate as received packet (was always 6Mbps in previous simulator versions)
  - DATA packet is also used for NAV updating by non-targetted terminals

New in version 0.5 (18/04/2002)
  - time stamp overflow throws error
  - transfer time is calculated
  - rate adaptation algorithm may use data rate of received packets to improve adaptation

New in version 1.0 (14/06/2002)
  - fragmentation
  - variable-length packets
  - program restructured for easier extension:
    - Packet class is now abstract and may be derived into different kinds of packets (MSDU,MPDU)
    - classes PHY, MAC and link_adapt created from Terminal functionalities
    - .h files contain only interface, private class members in _private.h
    - better documentation
  - log is now defined in configuration file, no need to recompile
  - traffic generator does not wait for MAC confirmation to send new packets. MAC has a packet
    queue

New in version 1.1 (20/06/2002)
  - traffic is not generated in class Terminal anymore, but in class Traffic
  - results can now ignore a given transient time
  - confidence interval is also calculated
  - command line option -it_file removed, now all results of all iterations are saved in results.txt

New in version 1.2 (02/08/2002)
  - power adaptation
  - several APs can be instantiated
