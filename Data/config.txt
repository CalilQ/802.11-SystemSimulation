% Physical Parameters
%
% If the number of access points == 1
%   One single round cell with one access point at the centre is assumed.
%   For more than one mobile station, they are uniformly distributed in the cell.
%   In case of only one station, then distance is fixed and equal to the cell radius.
%
% If the number of access points > 1
%   Access Point positions must be given.
%   Mobile Stations are are uniformly distributed in a circle of given  radius.
%   Each Mobile Station is associated to the nearest Access Point
%
% No terminal movement supported so far.

NumberAPs = 1 % number of access points
NumberStas = 3 % number of mobile terminals 
Radius = 10 % cell radius in meters

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Access Category (AC) parameters
% 
% Proportion of connections belonging to each access category.
% If the sum of proportions is such that the connections with specified AC is less than 
% NumberStats times 2,the remaining stations will belong to the highest priority AC present 
% in the specified ACs.
% If the sum of proportions is bigger than 1, an exception is thrown and the simulation stops.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Channel Parameters
%
% The received power is given by
%	  RxPower_dBm = TxPower_dBm - RefLoss_dB - 10*LossExponent*log10(d),
% where d is the distance in meters
%
% Channel is frequency-flat and Rayleigh-fading with Jakes' spectrum.
% Fading is generated by adding many sinusoidal signals (Jakes' method).

LossExponent = 3.0 % path loss exponent
RefLoss_dB = 46.7  % reference path loss at 1 m (according to Friis equation, Rappaport, pp. 72)
NoiseVariance_dBm = -95.0 % noise variance at receiverin dBm
DopplerSpread_Hz = 5.0    % maximum Doppler spread in Hz
NumberSinus = 20 % number of sinewaves to emulate Rayleigh fading.
                 % It should be >10 for good statistical properties.
